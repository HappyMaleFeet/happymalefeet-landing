## Understanding the Data

### First 24 Hours
Don't worry if numbers seem low at first. It takes time to build traffic.

### What to Look For:
- **Click-through rate**: Out of 100 visitors, how many click a button?
- **Telegram vs Throne**: Which one is more popular?
- **Traffic sources**: Are people finding you from social media? Direct links?
- **Peak times**: What days/times get the most traffic?

### Tips:
- Check weekly, not daily (daily can be misleading)
- Compare week-over-week to see growth
- If Telegram gets way more clicks, maybe promote Throne more
- If you share the link somewhere, check the spike in real-time!

## Troubleshooting

**Not seeing any data?**
- Wait 24-48 hours for data to populate
- Visit your own site (that counts!)
- Make sure you uploaded the NEW index.html file

**Real-time shows visitors but Reports don't?**
- Reports can take 24 hours to update
- Real-time is instant, Reports are delayed

**Want to exclude your own visits?**
1. Go to Admin → Data Settings → Data Filters
2. Create a filter to exclude your IP address

## Quick Wins

After launch, share your link on:
- Instagram story with "Link in bio"
- Twitter/X post
- Reddit (relevant communities)
- TikTok bio

Then check Google Analytics to see which platform sends the most traffic!
